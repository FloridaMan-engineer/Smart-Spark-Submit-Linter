Smart Spark: Linter & Advisor for spark-submitVersion: 5.1 "The Scope Fix"Smart Spark is a professional-grade command-line tool designed to lint, validate, and advise on spark-submit commands. It helps prevent common mistakes, promotes best practices, and assists in tuning your Spark jobs by comparing them against predefined resource profiles.Stop debugging failed jobs due to simple typos or misconfigurations. This tool catches errors before you submit.‚ú® Key FeaturesComprehensive Validation: Checks for over 40 common issues, including:Unknown, deprecated, or duplicate flags.Missing required parameters (--master, --class).Incorrectly formatted --conf properties.Logical conflicts (e.g., using --num-executors with dynamic allocation).Path validation and file existence checks.Resource sanity checks (e.g., too many cores, low memory per core).Interactive Advisor Mode: Analyzes your command and suggests the closest resource profile (small, medium, large). It highlights deviations and can automatically generate a corrected command.Strict Profile Conformance Mode: Validates your command against a specific, named profile to enforce team-wide standards.Best Practice Recommendations: Provides warnings and suggestions on performance tuning, such as setting spark.sql.shuffle.partitions, balancing driver/executor memory, and avoiding obsolete JVM options.Smart Suggestions: Catches typos and suggests the correct flag (e.g., --num-executors instead of --num-executor).Color-coded Output: Clearly distinguishes between critical errors and warnings for easy readability.‚öôÔ∏è InstallationClone the repository or download the script:git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
Install the required Python dependency:The script uses colorama for colored terminal output.pip install colorama
üöÄ UsageThe script is executed from your terminal, wrapping your entire spark-submit command in quotes.Interactive Advisor ModeThis is the default mode. The tool will analyze your command, identify the best-matching profile, show you how to conform to it, and then run a full linting report.Example:Let's say you have a command with a typo (--executor-core instead of --executor-cores) and suboptimal resource allocation.python smart_spark.py "spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster --name 'My App' --class com.example.Main --executor-memory 7g --num-executors 8 --executor-core 3 my_app.jar"
The tool will first suggest conforming to the medium profile and offer to apply the changes. After that, it will print a general report highlighting any other issues.Output might look like this:--- Spark Submit Interactive Advisor ---

‚úÖ Based on your parameters, the closest standard profile is 'medium'.

‚ö†Ô∏è The following changes are recommended to conform to the 'medium' profile standard:
  - Parameter '--executor-cores' value '3' does not match profile 'medium'.
    ‚Ü≥ Suggestion: Use the standard profile value of '4'.
  - Parameter '--executor-memory' value '7g' does not match profile 'medium'.
    ‚Ü≥ Suggestion: Use the standard profile value of '8g'.
  - Profile 'medium' expects conf 'spark.sql.shuffle.partitions', but it was not set.
    ‚Ü≥ Suggestion: Use the standard profile value of '80'.

Apply these changes and output the corrected command? (y/n): y

üìã--- Corrected Command for 'medium' Profile ---

spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster --name 'My App' --class com.example.Main --executor-memory 8g --num-executors 10 --executor-cores 4 --conf spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=80 my_app.jar

--- General Linting & Best Practices Report ---

‚ö†Ô∏è 1 WARNING(S) FOUND:
  1. Unknown parameter '--executor-core'.
     ‚Ü≥ Did you mean '--executor-cores'?

--- End of Report ---
Strict Profile-Checking ModeUse the --profile flag to enforce strict conformance against a predefined profile. The script will exit with an error if the command does not match. This is ideal for CI/CD pipelines or ensuring team standards.Example:python smart_spark.py --profile medium "spark-submit --master yarn --name 'My App' --class com.example.Main --num-executors 9 --executor-cores 4 --executor-memory 8g my_app.jar"
Output:--- Spark Submit Command Analysis ---

‚ö†Ô∏è 1 WARNING(S) FOUND:
  1. Parameter '--num-executors' value '9' does not match profile 'medium'.
     ‚Ü≥ Suggestion: Use the standard profile value of '10'.

--- End of Report ---
